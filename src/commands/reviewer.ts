/**
 * Per-iteration scanner that advances a ticket based on its worktree's pull
 * request state. Sits between the cleaner and the dispatcher in each
 * `orchestrate()` tick.
 *
 * - An **open** PR on an **in-progress** ticket → `markInReview`: frees a
 *   dispatch slot (slot math counts only in-progress) while leaving the
 *   worktree intact for review, since the cleaner only tears down `done`.
 * - A **merged** PR (on an in-progress or in-review ticket) → `markDone`:
 *   the work has landed, so the ticket is terminal and the cleaner tears the
 *   worktree down on a later tick. `merged` never routes to `in-review`.
 *
 * Sources that don't implement `markDone` (e.g. Linear) return `unsupported`;
 * the reviewer logs the skip and does nothing — there is no in-review
 * fallback. (Linear's own GitHub integration moves merged issues to Done,
 * which groundcrew observes via `fetch()`.)
 *
 * The write-back lands in the ticket source, not the in-memory `BoardState`,
 * so the dispatcher in the SAME tick still sees prior state; the slot frees on
 * the NEXT tick's `board.fetch()`. That one-tick latency is deliberate. One
 * per `orchestrate()`; stateless across iterations. Mirrors `Cleaner`.
