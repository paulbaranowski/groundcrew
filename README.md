────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Resolution
  [ok] Ticket exists in Linear ("Add retry logic to the sync job")
  [ok] Status is Todo
  [ok] Has agent-* label (agent-claude)

```

## Why

- **Linear-native.** Polls a project, respects `agent-*` labels, honors blockers.
- **One worktree per ticket.** Agents work in parallel without stepping on each other.
- **Local-first sandboxing.** Safehouse on macOS, Docker Sandboxes on Linux, or an explicit `none` escape hatch.
- **Multi-agent.** Ships with `claude` and `codex`; bring your own CLI by dropping a definition into `config.ts`.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @clipboard-health/groundcrew
```

Installs the `crew` binary. `@clipboard-health/clearance` is pulled in transitively and provides the `clearance` / `clearance-ensure` bins used by Safehouse runs.

## Quickstart

1. **Install prereqs.** Node 24, `git`, `cmux` _or_ `tmux`, and the agent CLIs themselves (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, …). Optional: `codexbar` for session-usage gating.

2. **Pick an isolation runner.** See [Runners](#runners) — `auto` resolves to `safehouse` on macOS and `sdx` on Linux/WSL.

3. **Create a Linear project to scope your work.** Any team works — make a project inside it and drop tickets in. The orchestrator polls by project, not by team.

4. **Configure.** Copy the shipped example into XDG config and edit:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew"
   cp "$(npm root -g)/@clipboard-health/groundcrew/configExample.ts" \
      "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew/config.ts"
   $EDITOR "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew/config.ts"
   ```

   Set `linear.projectSlug` (paste the trailing slug of your Linear project URL, e.g. `ai-strategy-5152195762f3`), `workspace.projectDir`, and `workspace.knownRepositories`. Defaults cover everything else.

   Then clone each repo before the first `crew run` — groundcrew creates per-ticket worktrees from these clones, it does not auto-clone:

   ```bash
   crew setup repos              # clone all missing entries via gh
   crew setup repos --dry-run    # preview
   crew setup repos owner/repo   # restrict to one entry
   ```

   `crew setup repos` is idempotent; already-cloned repos report `[exists]`. Bare-name entries (no `owner/`) are skipped — clone them manually into `<projectDir>/<name>`.

5. **Export a Linear API key.** `crew` reads `GROUNDCREW_LINEAR_API_KEY` first, then falls back to `LINEAR_API_KEY`.

   ```bash
   export GROUNDCREW_LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Using 1Password (<code>op</code>) for the key</summary>

   ```bash
   echo "GROUNDCREW_LINEAR_API_KEY='op://<vault>/LINEAR_API_KEY/credential'" > .env.1password
   op run --env-file .env.1password -- crew doctor
   ```

   </details>

6. **Run.**

   ```bash
   crew doctor                    # check setup
   crew run --dry-run             # preview without provisioning
   crew run --watch               # poll forever
   ```

## Runners

`local.runner` picks the local isolation backend. `auto` resolves per platform.

| Runner      | Default on  | Backend                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `safehouse` | macOS       | [Safehouse](https://agent-safehouse.dev/) — fastest local; cannot safely give the agent Docker.          |
| `sdx`       | Linux / WSL | [Docker Sandboxes](https://docs.docker.com/sandboxes/) (`sbx`) — required when the agent needs `docker`. |
| `none`      | —           | Unsandboxed escape hatch. Never picked implicitly; doctor warns when configured.                         |

For `sdx`: each model that runs under it needs a `sandbox: { agent: "<sbx-agent>" }` block in `config.ts`. Groundcrew names sandboxes `groundcrew-<agent>` (e.g. `groundcrew-claude`) and reuses one sandbox per agent across repos and tickets. First-time agent auth happens inside the sandbox the first time it launches. To bootstrap manually instead, run `sbx create --name groundcrew-<agent> <agent> <projectDir>` once.

<details>
<summary>Safehouse clearance allowlist</summary>

Only applies when `local.runner` resolves to `safehouse`. Groundcrew starts `clearance` on `http://127.0.0.1:19999` and runs the agent through the bundled `safehouse-clearance` wrapper. Clearance refuses to start without an allowlist — see [its README](https://github.com/ClipboardHealth/core-utils/tree/main/packages/clearance) for proxy env vars, log paths, and DNS rules. Shortest path:

```bash
CLEARANCE_ALLOW_HOSTS="api.openai.com,auth.openai.com,api.anthropic.com,mcp.linear.app,api.linear.app" \
crew run --watch
```

Groundcrew ships a starter file covering model APIs, Linear, Notion, Slack, Datadog, GitHub, npm, and common dev tooling at `$(npm root -g)/@clipboard-health/groundcrew/clearance-allow-hosts`. Point clearance at it (and optionally a personal file) via `CLEARANCE_ALLOW_HOSTS_FILES`:

```bash
CLEARANCE_ALLOW_HOSTS_FILES="$(npm root -g)/@clipboard-health/groundcrew/clearance-allow-hosts:$HOME/.config/clearance/personal-allow-hosts" \
crew run --watch
```

Watch `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/clearance/clearance.log` for `DENY` lines and add only the domains your agents actually need.

## Configuration

Three keys are required; everything else has a default.

| Key                           | What                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `linear.projectSlug`          | Trailing slug of the Linear project URL (e.g. `ai-strategy-5152195762f3`). |
| `workspace.projectDir`        | Parent dir for cloned repos and sibling ticket worktrees.                  |
| `workspace.knownRepositories` | Repos searched for in ticket descriptions to infer where work belongs.     |

`crew` resolves config as: `GROUNDCREW_CONFIG` if set → `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew/config.ts` if it exists → a `config.ts` next to `crew`'s own source (only useful from a local checkout). The branch prefix (`<prefix>-<TICKET>`) is derived from `os.userInfo().username` — not configurable.

Agent selection uses Linear labels: `agent-claude`, `agent-codex`, `agent-<name>`. `crew run` without `--ticket` only fetches tickets carrying an `agent-*` label — the GraphQL query filters server-side, so unlabeled tickets are never returned by Linear and do not appear on the board. Use `crew run --ticket <TICKET>` to provision an unlabeled ticket on demand (falls back to `models.default`). `agent-any` routes to the model with the most available session capacity. Todo tickets blocked by non-terminal blockers are skipped until their blockers reach a terminal status.

| `linear.projectSlug`                    | **required**        | Linear project URL slug (e.g. `ai-strategy-5152195762f3`). The trailing 12-char hex `slugId` is what's matched against Linear's API; the leading name keeps `config.ts` self-documenting and the lookup survives project renames.                                                         |

Explicit: `"safehouse"`, `"sdx"`, `"none"`. `"none"` is never picked implicitly.                                                                                                                            |

<summary>Disabling a shipped default</summary>

Groundcrew ships `claude` and `codex` as default model definitions, additively merged into every resolved config. To stop probing one:

```ts
// config.ts
export const config = {
  // …
  models: {
    default: "claude",
    definitions: {
      codex: { disabled: true },
    },
  },
};
```

Effects:

- `crew doctor` does not probe the disabled model's CLI. `crew doctor || exit 1` becomes viable as a CI gate when you only have one agent installed.
- `agent-any` only resolves to enabled models.
- An `agent-<disabled>` label on a ticket falls back to `models.default` with a warning in the log.

Rules:

- `disabled` only accepts shipped-default keys (`claude`, `codex`). A typo fails loudly at config load.
- `disabled` must be exactly the boolean `true`.
- It cannot be combined with `cmd`, `color`, or `usage` in the same entry.
- `models.default` must point at an enabled model.

</details>

## Commands

```bash
crew doctor                                              # full setup check
crew doctor --ticket <TICKET> [--no-linear] [--no-fetch] # full ticket lifecycle (dispatch + recovery)
crew run                                                 # one-shot dispatch
crew run --watch                                         # poll forever
crew run --ticket <TICKET>                               # provision one ticket and exit
crew setup repos [--dry-run] [<repo>...]
crew cleanup <TICKET>                                    # tear down every worktree carrying this ticket
```

`crew doctor --ticket <TICKET>` covers the full per-ticket lifecycle: pre-dispatch eligibility (Todo status, `agent-*` label, model resolution, repository mention, local clone, blockers, model session usage, in-progress capacity) **and** post-dispatch local-state recovery (host worktree, workspace pane, local branch, remote branch, open PR). Verdict precedence runs from post-dispatch outcomes down: `pr-open` > `pr-merged` > `in-flight` > `recoverable` > `unresolvable` > `ineligible` > `would-dispatch` > `lost`. Exits 0 on `would-dispatch`, `pr-open`, or `pr-merged`; any other verdict exits 1. `--watch` and `--ticket` are mutually exclusive. To inspect codexbar session windows directly, run `codexbar usage`.

### `crew doctor --ticket <ticket>`

Diagnose where a ticket is in its lifecycle and what to do next. Runs the same resolution and eligibility chain as the dispatcher, plus probes the host worktree, workspace pane, local branch, remote branch, and PR; prints a single verdict with a copy-pasteable recovery step when one applies.

Flags:

- `--no-linear` — skip the Linear GraphQL call. Resolution and Eligibility sections are skipped; verdicts that need only local state (`in-flight`, `recoverable`, `pr-open`, `pr-merged`, `lost`) still fire.
- `--no-fetch` — skip the upfront `git fetch origin <branch>` before checking remote presence.

The Workspace section appends an attach hint to the pane name when the workspace backend exposes one (e.g. `tmux attach -t <session>:<pane>` or `cmux attach <name>`), so the verdict line is immediately actionable. The hero above shows a passing pre-dispatch run; here's the same command on a ticket that's already past dispatch:

```text
groundcrew doctor --ticket HRD-442 (Multi-event extractor: year inference can produce date_start > date_end)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Resolution
  [ok] Ticket exists in Linear ("Multi-event extractor: year inference can produce date_start > date_end")

#### Recovering a stranded ticket

The verdict on the last line maps to a recovery action:

| Verdict          | What to do                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pr-open`        | Nothing — the PR is the source of truth.                                                      |
| `pr-merged`      | Done.                                                                                         |
| `in-flight`      | The ticket is still being worked on; the verdict line names the workspace pane to attach to.  |
| `recoverable`    | Run the printed `nextStep` exactly.                                                           |
| `would-dispatch` | Pre-dispatch checks pass; the orchestrator will pick the ticket up on its next tick.          |
| `ineligible`     | A resolution or eligibility check failed; the reason after the colon names the failing check. |
| `unresolvable`   | The Linear ticket couldn't be fetched; the reason after the colon names the error.            |
| `lost`           | No trace exists. Re-dispatch via `crew run --ticket <ticket>`.                                |

## Troubleshooting

First stop for "labeled but not on the board": `crew doctor --ticket <ticket>` lists every check the dispatcher runs and flags the failing one.

<details>
<summary>Local execution picks one of safehouse / sdx / none</summary>

`local.runner: "auto"` resolves to `safehouse` on macOS and `sdx` (Docker Sandboxes) on Linux/WSL. Override with `local.runner: "safehouse" | "sdx" | "none"`. There is no per-model `isolation` knob — the runner is global. `sdx` requires a per-model `sandbox: { agent }` block so groundcrew can map the model to an sbx agent.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Safehouse-already-wrapped commands are not re-wrapped</summary>

If a `models.definitions.<name>.cmd` already starts with `safehouse`, groundcrew assumes that command owns its Safehouse flags and does not add the `safehouse-clearance` wrapper a second time. Changing the proxy's allowlist after it's running requires killing the PID in `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/clearance/clearance.pid` so the next launch picks up the new env.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sandbox lifecycle is create-only</summary>

Groundcrew auto-creates the sandbox for an sbx agent (`groundcrew-<agent>`) when missing, but never deletes one — sandboxes persist across tickets and across `crew cleanup`. Auth state lives inside the sandbox, so deleting it forces a re-login. Inspect or remove them manually with `sbx ls` / `sbx rm`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Dead tmux windows vanish by default</summary>

When a wrapped agent command fails (e.g. `safehouse-clearance` not found, `npm install` crash), the tmux window closes immediately and the error scrolls into the void. Set `GROUNDCREW_KEEP_DEAD_WINDOWS=1` in the env you launch `crew` from to flip the per-window `remain-on-exit` to `on`; the window stays open with the error visible. Close it manually with `tmux kill-window -t groundcrew:<ticket>` after diagnosis. tmux backend only.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Status names matter</summary>

If your team uses `Started` instead of `In Progress`, set `linear.statuses.inProgress = "Started"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Leaf-only</summary>

Parent issues with children are ignored — sub-issues are the work items.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tickets stay in-progress until something else moves them</summary>

Groundcrew sets a ticket to `inProgress` when it provisions a workspace and never advances it. The next transition (typically "in review" when a PR opens) is left to your Linear automation rules.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Project must be on a single Linear team in practice</summary>

Cross-team projects work — the orchestrator caches the in-progress state ID per team — but every team in the project must use the same status name for `linear.statuses.inProgress`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude launches in bypass-permissions mode by default</summary>

Groundcrew creates isolated per-ticket worktrees for unattended runs, so the shipped `claude` command is `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions` to avoid workspace-trust and tool-permission prompts blocking automation. Override `models.definitions.claude.cmd` for a stricter mode.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Doctor's command introspection is shallow</summary>

Doctor reports the resolved local runner (safehouse / sdx / none) and whether its prerequisites are met, then tokenizes model `cmd` and checks the first two non-flag tokens against PATH. Boolean flags without values, env-var assignments (`FOO=1`), shell pipelines, and subshells are not parsed — verify those manually. When `local.runner` is `"none"`, doctor surfaces a single WARNING line.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Doctor checks every enabled model</summary>

`models.definitions` includes both shipped defaults (`claude`, `codex`) by default via additive merge. If you only intend to label tickets `agent-claude` and don't have `codex` installed, set `models.definitions.codex: { disabled: true }` (see "Disabling a shipped default" above). Without that, doctor exits non-zero on a missing `codex` binary even though `crew run` would never route to it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Switch to tmux if cmux is misbehaving</summary>

Set `workspaceKind: "tmux"` to force the tmux backend when cmux's CLI/socket bridge is flaky (symptoms: `cmux --json list-workspaces` returning `Failed to write to socket (Broken pipe)` or `Socket not found at ...cmux.sock` on every tick). tmux is more reliable — just a unix socket, no GUI app — at the cost of losing cmux's status pills, notifications, and sidebar.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Agent CLI must accept a positional prompt</summary>

The handoff is `<your cmd> "<prompt>"`. `claude`, `codex`, and `cursor-agent` all support this.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>crew setup repos</code> only auto-clones <code>owner/repo</code> entries</summary>

Bare-name entries in `workspace.knownRepositories` (e.g. `"api"` rather than `"clipboardhealth/api"`) are skipped with a hint to clone manually — the command refuses to guess the owner. After a partial setup, the exit code is non-zero so CI gates notice; rerun is idempotent once you clone the bare ones into `<projectDir>/<name>` yourself.

</details>

## Development

Clone the repo and the `crew` / `crew:op` scripts execute straight from TypeScript source — no build step needed.

```bash
cd ~/dev/c/groundcrew
node --run crew -- doctor

# With 1Password for GROUNDCREW_LINEAR_API_KEY:
node --run crew:op -- run --watch
```

Both forms read `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew/config.ts` by default; set `GROUNDCREW_CONFIG` to point elsewhere. The `crew:op` wrapper additionally reads `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/groundcrew/op.env` (1Password env-file with `op://` references resolved at launch).

Logs land in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/groundcrew/groundcrew.log` by default (override via `logging.file`). The "Loaded config from …" line at startup tells you which config won.

Source edits in `src/**` are picked up on the next invocation. Requires Node ≥ 24.3 (native `.ts` type stripping).
